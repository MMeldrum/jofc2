# JOFC2 - Java API for Open Flash Chart 2
This project provides a Java library for utilizing Open Flash Chart 2 (http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/).

It is a fork of ofcj (http://code.google.com/p/ofcj/) because the project seemed to be freezed. 
On the long run the idea is to provide a stable and well maintained library for use in industrial projects. Therefore feedback and contribution is very welcome, since an OSS project is only as good as its community.
